## Credits

This project was inspired by a stopwatch example featured on [üîó 100 JS Projects](https://www.100jsprojects.com/project/stopwatch)

While the core logic was based on the original concept, the final UI, keyboard controls, and button behavior were custom-developed and refined during my learning process.
