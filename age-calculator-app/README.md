# Age Calculator App ðŸŽ‚

This project is a **minimalist age calculator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate their age based on their date of birth, with the option to specify a custom reference date. If no reference date is provided, the app defaults to **today's date**.

## Credits

This project was inspired by a stopwatch example featured on [ðŸ”— 100 JS Projects](https://www.100jsprojects.com/project/age-calculator)

While the core logic was based on the original concept, the final UI, keyboard controls, and button behavior were custom-developed and refined during my learning process.
